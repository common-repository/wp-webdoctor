Powerful and effective wordpress security and firewall plugin for your site.

== Description ==
= WP Webdoctor - WordPres Security Plugin: Antivirus & Virus Scanner =

WordPress itself is a very secure platform. However, it helps to add some extra security and firewall to your site by using a security plugin that enforces a lot of good security practices.

The WP Webdoctor Security plugin will take your website security to a whole new level.

This plugin is designed and written by experts and is easy to use and understand.

It reduces security risk by checking for vulnerabilities, and by implementing and enforcing the latest recommended WordPress security practices and techniques.

All In One WP Security also uses an unprecedented security points grading system to measure how well you are protecting your site based on the security features you have activated.

Our security and firewall rules are categorized into "basic", "intermediate" and "advanced". This way you can apply the firewall rules progressively without breaking your site's functionality.

The WP Webdoctor Security plugin doesn't slow down your site and it is 100% free.

Below is a list of the security and firewall features offered in this plugin:

= User Accounts Security =
* Detect if there is a user account which has the default "admin" username and easily change the username to a value of your choice.
* The plugin will also detect if you have any WordPress user accounts which have identical login and display names. Having account's where display name is identical to login name is bad security practice because 
you are making it 50% easier for hackers because they already know the login name.
* Password strength tool to allow you to create very strong passwords.
* Stop user enumeration. So users/bots cannot discover user info via author permalink.

= User Login Security =
